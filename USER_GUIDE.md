## üè∑Ô∏è Organization Tips

### Effective Tagging

1. **Be Consistent**
   - Use the same terms (e.g., "landscape" not "landscapes")
   - Create a personal tagging system

2. **Use Hierarchies**
   - Broad to specific: "travel, europe, france, paris"
   - Objects to details: "food, dinner, pasta, italian"

3. **Include Context**
   - When: "2023, summer, vacation"
   - Where: "home, office, outdoors"
   - Who: "family, friends, work"

### Categories vs Tags

- **Categories** - Broad classifications (nature, work, family)
- **Tags** - Specific descriptors (sunset, meeting, birthday)
- Use both for maximum organization

### Search Strategies

1. **Start Broad** - Use categories first
2. **Add Filters** - Narrow with tags or text
3. **Use Favorites** - For frequently accessed images
4. **Sort Results** - By date for chronological view
